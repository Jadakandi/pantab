What is it?
-----------

``pantab`` is a Python wrapper around Tableau's `Hyper API <https://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/index.html>`_ which promotes usage of the `pandas DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_ to seamlessly generate and read hyper extracts.

How do I get it?
----------------

``pantab`` requires Python 3.6+ and can run on any Python-supported OS. You additionally will need to `install the Hyper API <https://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/docs/hyper_api_installing.html>`_ per Tableau's documentation (as of writing, that package is unfortunately not available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org>`_.

With those pre-requisites installed, installation is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pantab
